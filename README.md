Question-  What is the use of the keyof keyword in TypeScript?
Answer -  The keyof keyword creates a union type of all the keys of a given object type, enabling safer and more dynamic access to object properties during type checking.

Question- Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript.
Answer - any disables all type checks, unknown is a safer alternative requiring type checks before use, and never represents values that should never occur.
